What is your favorite thing about javascript and what is your 
least favorite thing about javascript? Why?

Basically as long as the features you mention are actually features of javascript
and you give reasons you should be fine. This is meant to be an open ended, 
subjective question to test the applicants ability to respond when faced with
tough questions or questions they haven't thought about before.
