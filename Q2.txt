/*
 * Access modifiers are keywords attached to class members (fields and methods)
    to define where these fields/methods can be called from.
    TypeScript defines 3 access levels:
    public - can be accessed anywhere (Default)
    protected - can be accessed from extending classes
    private - can be accessed only from within defining class
 
    (Access modifiers are part of the encapsulation pillar of OOP)
    Encapsulation is the idea that a class or object should maintain
    its own state, which should not be directly accessed by any external
    code.
